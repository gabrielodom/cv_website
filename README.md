Somehow, after all these years, I forgot to commit everything to GitHub. Oops.

The template I've been using broke somehow, and I can't figure out how the `layout` key in the YAML header connects to the `cv.html` file which is supposed to reference `_config.yml` (without a file name, so by default?) which sets the `.css` file name. It's spaghetti of CSS and HTML file that I can't sort out.

I switched the whole file to Quarto, and now I'm calling the .css directly. This won't be the best fix for when I need to print to Word, but I think it will work for now. The new website is <https://gabriel.quarto.pub/cv/>.

Update the label colours from UM to FIU in `davewhipp-screen.css`.

This is the directory for my web-hosted cv. I'm using the work from <https://github.com/elipapa/markdown-cv>. My website is <https://rpubs.com/gabrielodom/curriculum_vitae>.
